The application provides users with real-time weather information and forecasts for their desired locations. The HTML and CSS were utilized to create the structure and design of the web app, ensuring a visually appealing and intuitive user experience. JavaScript was used to handle user interactions and fetch data from the weather API. The API integration enables the app to retrieve accurate weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric conditions. The application dynamically updates the weather information, ensuring users have the most up-to-date details. The combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the weather API allows for a seamless and responsive weather web app that delivers comprehensive weather forecasts to users. This project demonstrates the power of web technologies in providing real-time weather information and enhancing user experiences.
